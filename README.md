# SE_ResNet18
Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SE) enables the CNNs to learn the channel-wise informative features and improve model accuracy with a slightly additional computation cost. 
This is a toy model of ResNet18 trained and run on CIFAR10 dataset. The model is deveoped with Pytorch and trained with 200 epochs on The Iridis Compute Cluster of University of Southampton.
